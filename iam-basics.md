# IAM Basics

IAM stands for **Identity and Access Management**.

IAM is a security framework that ensures:

- Has the right access
- To the right resource
- At the right time

Identity contains:
- Name
- Email
- Employee ID
- Department
- Role

## What is an Account?
An account is a technical representation of identity in a system.

## Why IAM is Important?
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Improves security
- Automates user access

## IAM Lifecycle

1. Joiner – Employee joins company
