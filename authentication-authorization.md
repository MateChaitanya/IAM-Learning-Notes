# Authentication vs Authorization

---

## Authentication

Authentication answers:
👉 **Who are you?**

Examples:
- Username & Password
- OTP
- Biometrics
- MFA

If authentication fails → no access.

---

## Authorization

Authorization answers:
👉 **What are you allowed to access?**

Examples:
- Read access
- Write access
- Admin access

Authorization happens **after authentication**.

## Simple Example

Login to email:
- Authentication: Login with password
- Authorization: Inbox access

---

## MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

Uses more than one factor:
- Something you know (password)
- Something you have (OTP)
- Something you are (fingerprint)

MFA improves security.
